Abstract classes cannot be instantiated,means we cannot create objects of an abstract class directly.
Abstract classes can have abstract methods which are declared without an implementation in the abstract class.the derived classes must provide the implementation for these methods .
Abstract classes can also have regular methods with implementations.
Abstract classes can have instance variables, constructors,and can provide common functionality to derived classes.
Derived classes extend the abstract class using the 'extends'keywords.
