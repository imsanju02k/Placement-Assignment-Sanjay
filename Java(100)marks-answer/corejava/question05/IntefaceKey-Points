Interface cannot be instantiated,meaning you cannot create objects of an interface directly.
Interfaces only have method signatures, without any implementation.
A Class can implement multiple interfaces,separated by commas.
Interface provide a way to achieve multiple inheritance in java.
Interfaces are used to define contracts,specifying what methods a class implementing the interface must have.
